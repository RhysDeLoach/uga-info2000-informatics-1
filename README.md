# INFO 2000 – Informatics I  
University of Georgia | Spring 2024

This repository contains selected coursework from **INFO 2000: Informatics I**, completed during my undergraduate studies at the University of Georgia.

The course provided a foundational introduction to data science, covering programming, mathematics, data management, and computer systems, with an emphasis on applying these skills to real-world problems through hands-on assignments and projects.

## Repository Structure
- `assignments/` – Programming exercises and homework focused on foundational concepts in data science and informatics  
- `mini-projects/` – Short, applied programming projects integrating multiple course topics

---

## Notable Work
- **Mini Project 1 – Probability Simulation and Automated Email Generation**  
  Simulated the Monty Hall problem to analyze winning probabilities with and without switching doors. The project also included an automated email generation component that created randomized student email addresses and populated templated emails with selected attractions.

- **Mini Project 2 – Database-Backed Web Application**  
  Implemented a Flask-based web application that allows users to add, store, and search products in an SQLite database. The application features form validation, dynamic querying, and HTML template rendering.
